# On the command line, cp and mv will overwrite any existing target file, 
# but you can make them prompt. I recommend these two aliases because 
# without them, cp and mv do two jobs: copying/moving and deleting. 
# Not having cp and mv delete files is more in keeping with the unix philosophy 
# (one command does one job) and less error-prone. 
# This is completely different from rm -i, which asks for confirmation before 
# doing its job â€” such a systematic prompt tends to trigger an automatic 
# response and thus becomes a useless annoyance.
